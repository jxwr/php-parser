# Test Files

## Testing

Files included here should be valid PHP. They are parsed by the bulk_test.go file and if *any*
of them fails to compile, the test will fail. The purpose is to increase the speed with which
scenarios may be tested during development, but this should only be considered a temporary
substitute for fuller unit testing.

## Removal

These files are included solely for testing this parser against a variety of code. Many are
handwritten for testing purposes, but some are included after finding bugs when parsing
external code. If you find your code here and would like it removed, please file an issue
and we will gladly comply.
